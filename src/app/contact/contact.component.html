  Before getting in touch, I want to tell you a bit more about how this is going to work:
  <li>
    Once everything is set up for us to begin, we will have a call to get to know each other.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    I will ask you questions in order to be very clear on what you need and how soon you need it. This step is very important, as I want to make sure to build the site you want for your business.
  </li>

  <li>
    I will separate all of your requirements into smaller parts (functionalities), order them by priority, and start working on the most urgent and important ones first.
    I will follow the steps described in my <a href="process">process</a> section.
  </li>

  <li>
    Around the end of the project (or around the end of each milestone), we will have a short call where I will make you a demo of the functionality implemented, and you will give me your feedback.
  </li>

  <li>
    I will send you the project deliverables, and your site will go live.
  </li>

  <li>
    After the site goes live, we will take care of the payment.
  </li>
</ul>
